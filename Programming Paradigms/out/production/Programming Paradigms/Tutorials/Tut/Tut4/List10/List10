TASK 1:
 Supposing we have declared the classes Animal, Dog and Cat as in the document, the code above will generate an error
because:

 If we create a val 'dogSeq' as a Sequence[Dog] we can make a new val 'animalSeq' equal to 'dogSeq':
>val dogSeq = new Sequence[Dog]
>val animalSeq = dogSeq
 This is correct. But if we have another val 'catSeq' and we do something like this:
>val catSeq = animalSeq
 It is not correct. We are telling the compiler that a Sequence of Dog contains now Cat.


TASK 2:
import scala.collection.mutable

def copy[A] (collection: mutable.Set[A]):mutable.Set[A] = {
  collection.clone()
}
val set = mutable.Set(1,2,3)
val setCopy = copy(set)
set.remove(1)
set
setCopy


TASK 3:
In Java, Arrays ara covariant. An explanation could be the next:

 If we treat arrays as invariant then some methods such as Equals would not work. This is because while writing the
 method we would only be able to compare arrays of the same type. Fortunately, as arrays in Java are covariant, the
 method Equals written as:

 boolean equalArrays(Object[] a1, Object[] a2);

 would compare the two different arrays and not only they are of type Object[]. We can compare String, Int, etc as
 they are subtypes of Object.




TASK 4:
Collections in Java are invariant, they do not support covariant or contravariant substitutions.

 A good explanation for this is the task 1 of this list. To sump up, we cannot guarantee what type of elements
 the Collection originally constructed for.
